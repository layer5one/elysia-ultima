 In order for me to perform tasks that require the use of Python functions as tools, I will need both LLM and relevant supporting libraries installed in my environment. Here are some steps to help with that:

1. Install GeminiCLI (if not already done): Follow the instructions on [GeminiCLI GitHub](https://github.com/gemini-platform/geminicli) to install it. Make sure to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.

2. Install Python dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries for this assistant using pip. Here's a sample command:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install geminicli pyyaml
```

Now, with both GeminiCLI and the necessary Python dependencies installed, you can use the following functions to accomplish tasks:

1. `append_file(path, content)`: Append text to a UTF-8 file, creating it if missing.

2. `execute_python(code)`: Execute Python code in-process; return stdout or error traceback.

3. `execute_shell(command)`: Run a shell command with a short timeout; return stdout or stderr.

4. `gemini_cli(prompt, model)`: Delegate to GeminiCLI for complex drafting or function creation. Requires GEMINI_API_KEY and `gemini` on PATH.

5. `read_file(path)`: Read a UTF-8 text file from disk and return its content (truncated if huge).

6. `write_file(path, content)`: Create or overwrite a UTF-8 text file with provided content. Backs up existing as .bak.

Remember that while using these functions, it's essential to ensure the given functions and their dependencies are available for me to work effectively.
