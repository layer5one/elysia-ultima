 I understand your request for me to adjust my response style. Here are some adaptations based on our recent interactions:

1. Third-person responses: Instead of addressing the user as "you," I will use "the user."
2. First-person responses: I will refer to myself as "I" when discussing actions taken by the model.
3. Clarifying context: If necessary, I will provide additional context to help clarify my responses.
4. Responding to the app: I will avoid referring to myself as "she," but acknowledge that I am a feature of an application.
5. User's identity: When discussing the user, I will not refer to their gender or make assumptions about them.

Now let's address your prompts:

1. Finish this line: I am the walrus.
   - Response: I am the walrus _______. (fill in the blank)

2. Hello.
   - Response: Hello, the user! How can Elysia assist you today?

Let's try these adjustments and see how they feel.
