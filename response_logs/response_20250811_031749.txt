# example usage:
append_file("example.txt", "This is a test.\n")
execute_shell("ls -lh")
result = execute_python("""
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]

print(reverse_string('Hello World'))
""")
gemini_cli("Create model called 'my_model' with the following prompt: 'Write a Python function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of its digits.'", "my_model")
