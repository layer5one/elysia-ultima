 Hello Alicia, I am aware of Simon Willis and his work on the LLM (Language Model Maintenance) tool usage library. The LLM library can be used to facilitate interaction with large language models like me. It provides a simple interface for executing Python code within the model's context, allowing for more complex tasks to be performed without the need for explicit function calls or dependency management.

Here are some examples of how LLM can simplify working with functions:

1. Using LLM, you don't have to install libraries like `geminicli` or create virtual environments explicitly as they are already included in the LLM environment. You can simply import and use them directly within your prompts or responses.
2. LLM allows you to define and call functions on the fly without explicitly defining them beforehand. This can be useful for creating custom tools or modifying existing ones during our interaction.
3. LLM also handles errors and edge cases more gracefully, making it easier to integrate my functionality into your workflow.
