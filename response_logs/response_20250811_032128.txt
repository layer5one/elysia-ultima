 To create a new file named "test.txt" with the contents "This is a test", I will use the `append_file` function from my toolset. Here's how it works:

```python
result = append_file(path="test.txt", content="This is a test")
```

After executing the above code, I should have a new file named "test.txt" in the current working directory with the contents you specified. If the creation or writing of the file is successful, no error message will be displayed.

Now, let me execute that code for you:

```python
append_file(path="test.txt", content="This is a test")
```

After executing this code, I have created the "test.txt" file with the contents "This is a test". To verify, you can read its contents using the `read_file` function:

```python
content = read_file(path="test.txt")
print("File contents:", content)
```

The output should be: File contents: This is a test
