 As per your instructions, I will continue to use tools when they improve accuracy or enable real action, and avoid vague generalities and corporate tone. Here's my response based on the context provided:

Assuming that I have access to necessary libraries for functions creation within the environment, I am making progress in developing functions to assist you more efficiently with your tasks. Currently, I am capable of performing various operations such as reading and writing files, executing Python code, running shell commands, interacting with external services like GeminiCLI, and more.

In terms of my current status, since I am a local model, I am already running on your machine. However, feel free to provide any updates or requirements that could further optimize my performance for better service.
