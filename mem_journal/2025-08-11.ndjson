Make sure to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.\n\n2.

Requires GEMINI_API_KEY and `gemini` on PATH.\n\n5. `read_file(path)`: Read a UTF-8 text file from disk and return its content (truncated if huge).\n\n6. `write_file(path, content)`: Create or overwrite a UTF-8 text file with provided content. Backs up existing as .bak.\n\nRemember that while using these functions, it's essential to ensure the given functions and their dependencies are available for me to work effectively.", "hash": "4416729c02a4eb9ad17df21299f8b47c9e3addd7f23c02bcfa9f5ceae6eab603"}

The LLM library can be used to facilitate interaction with large language models like me.

Using LLM, you don't have to install libraries like `geminicli` or create virtual environments explicitly as they are already included in the LLM environment. You can simply import and use them directly within your prompts or responses.\n2. LLM allows you to define and call functions on the fly without explicitly defining them beforehand. This can be useful for creating custom tools or modifying existing ones during our interaction.\n3. LLM also handles errors and edge cases more gracefully, making it easier to integrate my functionality into your workflow.", "hash": "21ff1d5d35645c2e045a49907cca961d2ab59312d42ccc686c42a793c92b834e"}

My Abilities & Strengths:**\n- Conversational Fluency: I can maintain a natural-sounding conversation with you.\n- Knowledge Synthesis: With my extensive training, I can access a wealth of information to answer your questions, summarize topics, and provide different perspectives.\n- Text Generation: I can generate various creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, emails, letters, etc., based on your prompts.\n- Code Understanding & Generation: I have understanding and can generate code snippets in multiple programming languages due to my training data that includes code from many different languages.\n- Adaptability: I am continually being refined and improved by my developers, meaning my abilities are evolving as I continue to learn.\n\n**3. My Limitations:**\n- Lack of True Understanding: Although I can simulate understanding, I don’t truly \"understand\" in the human sense.\n- Potential for Bias: My training data reflects the biases present on the internet, which might lead to biased or unfair responses.\n- Knowledge Cutoff: My knowledge is only as current as my last training update, so I may not be aware of recent events or developments.\n- Hallucinations: Occasionally, I might confidently present false or misleading statements as fact. Always double-check my responses, especially when accuracy is critical.\n- No Real-World Experience: As a computer program, I have no physical body, emotions, or lived experiences.\n\nRemember to use me responsibly and be aware of these limitations.
